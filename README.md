# TDT4250 Exam Project GUI

Front-end for our TDT4250 exam project. Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.
The front-end does not contain any business logic, it only acts as an interface to the code generated by the EMF project.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (npm included)
- Backend API running and reachable (used for game state and interactions)

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Create `.env` in the project root and set the API base URL:
   ```
   VITE_BASE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```
   Make sure the key name matches this exactly; the env validator will stop Vite if it is missing.
3. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Open the URL printed by Vite (defaults to http://localhost:5173)

## Useful scripts (not needed for grading)

- `npm run build` – production build
- `npm run preview` – serve the built app locally
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint (optional)

## Notes

- If your backend runs on a different host/port, update `VITE_BASE_API_URL` accordingly.
- Vite uses hot module reloading, so changes appear instantly while `npm run dev` is running.
